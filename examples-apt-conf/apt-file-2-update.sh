This script will configure your system to only update Contents files
when "apt-file update" is run.  This is done by installing two config
files for APT.

To do this, please run the following as root:
  $0 --install

NB: Depending on your system and your APT configuration, you may have
to tweak the resulting /etc/apt/apt-file.conf to ensure you do not
fetch somethings twice (it uses a blacklist).

If you want to undo it, then as root run:
  $0 --uninstall

CAVEAT: During --uninstall will simply remove the files/directories
created by this script *WITHOUT ANY BACKUP*.  Manual changes to
e.g. /etc/apt/apt-file.conf *WILL BE LOST*.
