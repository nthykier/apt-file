DESCRIPTION

apt-file allows you to find in which package a file is included. This
application has the same behaviour as the web version found at
http://packages.debian.org.

Additionally you can list all files included in a package without
installing or downloading it (see dpkg -S and dpkg --contents for more
details about listing a package content).

See the apt-file(1) man page for more details
