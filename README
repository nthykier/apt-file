apt-file version 2.0.5
(c) 2001-5 Sebastien J. Gross <sjg@debian.org>

DESCRIPTION

apt-file allows you to find in which package a file is included. This
application has the same behaviour as James Treacy's script
found at http://packages.debian.org.

Additionally you can list all files included in a package without
installing or downloading it (see dpkg -S and dpkg --contents for more
details about listing a package content).

INSTALLATION

apt-file requires Andy Wardley's AppConfig perl module version 1.52 or
greater found on the CPAN (http://www.cpan.org).

Run make install to install apt-file.

USAGE

See apt-file (1) man page for more details

Please note that curl is needed with _THE DEFAULT_ configuration file only
If you prefer using wget, it's up to you but you _MUST_ change the
confinguration file according to your choice.
This explains why neither wget nor curl are in the package dependencies but
recommended instead.
