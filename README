DESCRIPTION

apt-file allows you to find in which package a file is included. This
application has the same behaviour than the James Treacy's script
found at http://packages.debian.org.

In an other hand you can list all files included in a package without
installing or downloading it (see dpkg -S and dpkg --contents for more
details about listing a package content).

INSTALLATION

apt-file requires Andy Wardley's AppConfig perl module version 1.52 or
greater found on the CPAN (http://www.cpan.org).
