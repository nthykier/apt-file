    using APT's acquire system.  Thanks to Jakub Wilk for
    the report.  (Closes: #809264)

apt-file (3.0~exp) experimental; urgency=medium

  * BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
    - diffindex-download and diffindex-rred has been removed!
      (Closes: #788780)
    - apt-file now exit with non-zero exit code when the
      query results in no matches.  (Closes: #505222)
    - apt-file no longer supports "personal" caches on its
      own.
    - apt-file show (a.k.a. list) now looks up only an exact
      package name by default.  To retain the previous
      behaviour, please use the new --substring-match option.
    - Special uses of "-a" to search in Source packages or
      udebs have been replaced by "--index-names".
    - apt-file now uses "gnu-getopt" option style parsing.
      Notably this means that "+" cannot be used for options
      any longer.
  * Rewrite apt-file to use apt's new acquire system.  By using
    apt, apt-file:
    - makes apt refresh the Contents files.
      (Closes: #476401, #594879)
    - now understands "non-release" lines.  (Closes: #297707)
    - no longer sends "double" requests.  (Closes: #663417)
    - now validates downloads correctly.  (Closes: #515942)
    - can resume downloads (like apt).  (Closes: #594879)
    - now respects Acquire::http::Dl-Limit.  (Closes: #525631)
    - supports deb822 sources.list file.  (Closes: #740978)
    - supports tor+http protocol (Closes: #764349)
    - supports "mirror" protocol (Closes: LP: #888316,
      LP: #1156717, LP: #1395988)
    - respects APT proxy settings (Closes: LP: #817517,
      LP: #767061)
    - now silently accepts that not all mirrors have Contents
      files (Closes: LP#567895, LP#619659).
    (Closes: #752292)
  * Expand the README a bit to give a quick introduction to
    apt-file and indices.
  * Rewrite the manpage from docbook to POD format.
  * Update dependency lists due to the above rewrites.
  * Remove the old apt-file cache on upgrade.  This means that
    users will have to run "apt update" after upgrading.
  * Update the "is-cache-empty" and "do-apt-file-update"
    scripts.
  * Rewrite d/rules to use debhelper "tiny" and bump the
    compat level 9.
  * Add --substring-match option to apt-file.
  * Update bash completions to match the changes.
  * Install bash-completions in their new location and drop
    old bash-completion conffile.

  * mention rapt-file in the package description (Closes: #623632)

  [ Thijs Kinkhorst ]
  * apt-file: Include compontent in Contents file search paths so we

    compatibility with older suites that do not have this configuration
    (Closes: #624734).
  * rapt-file: Ignore files not ending in .list in sources.list.d
    (Closes: #607861).

apt-file (2.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Stefan Fritsch ]
  * Hijack package. New maintainer.
  * Add Thijs as uploader.
  * Acknowledge NMU (closes: #397381). Thanks to Gunnar Wolf and Kevin Glynn.
  * Import changes from Ubuntu. This fixes these bugs:
    - Regular expression search with -x does not really work (Closes: #259446)
    - fails to read /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ (Closes: #353275)
    - manpage says dpkg -S when it means dpkg -L (Closes: #376828)
    - please apply more complete patch to fix output (Closes: #382312)
    - silently fails when there are no file lists (Closes: #408309)
    - bash_completion: `_apt-file': not a valid identifier (Closes: #441041)
    - bash_completion does not complete filename after search command
      (Closes: #448358)
    - typo in apt-file.conf (Closes: #451840)
    Thanks to Daniel Hahler, Emmet Hikory, and Barry deFreese.
  * Fix misleading error message when cache dir does not exist
    (Closes: #456166).
  * Set umask on apt-file update to ensure cache is always world readable
    (Closes: #361878).
  * Don't show files repeatedly which are in the same package in several suites
    (Closes: #402228).
  * Allow bundling of short options (Closes: #384013).
  * Correctly extract file and directory names from apt config
    (Closes: #446621).
  * Use zfgrep to speed up non-regex searches (Closes: #470488). To be able to
    do this, we need a different way to trim the header of Contents.gz than
    used in the patch for bug #382312 (Closes: #293942).
  * Pass 'set -x' to the shell when in verbose mode.
  * Refactor apt-file.conf:
    - Move common code blocks in apt-file.conf to separate variables.
    - Use gunzip -l instead of file to check if a file is gzipped.
    - Fix misleading comments (Closes: #356790).
    - Remove chmod 644 since we now set umask correctly.
  * Correctly handle parentheses in regexp searches (Closes: #467619).
  * Correctly handle fixed string (-F) searches (Closes: #469375).
  * Remove update-notifier hook file when package is purged.
  * Remove cdbs build dependency.
  * Add vcs header to debian/control.

  [ Thijs Kinkhorst ]
  * Remove ancient versioned-depends on essential package gzip.
  * Add missing debhelper compat file.
  * Correct misspelled architecture variable name, makes architecture
    selection work again. Thanks Enno Cramer (Closes: #364411).
  * Change suggestion from ssh to openssh-client (Closes: #375578).
  * Many documentation cleanups (thanks Era Eriksson for some,
    Closes: #320322, #412133).
  * Rebuild man page from sgml during package build.
  * Change section to admin, following override.
  * Drop -N parameter from wget command since it's not allowed in
    combination with -O according to the manual (Closes: #380736).

 -- Daniel Hahler <ubuntu@thequod.de>  Sun, 09 Mar 2008 17:42:01 +0100

apt-file (2.0.8.2ubuntu3) hardy; urgency=low

  * Improved "need to run apt-file update" experience (LP: #154180)
    - debian/apt-file.postinst:
      - Do not call apt-file update anymore directly
      - install update-notifier hook
    - debian/control: Depend on "menu" for su-to-root
    - apt-file: test if the cache directory is empty for actions
      search/find and show/list.
  * apt-file: reverted removal of leading slash in pattern and implement
    logic to match both without slash at the beginning and with slash
    inside (LP: #181600). Apply the same logic to regexp patterns (-x).
  * debian/rules:
    - moved DH_COMPAT=3 to debian/compat (increased to 5)
    - Fixed debian-rules-ignores-make-clean-error
    - Dropped binary-arch target
  * Fix typos/wording in README
  * apt-file.conf: Add integrity check for fetched files (LP: #176753)
  * apt-file: find_command: remove leading spaces and open parentheses
    before looking for the command, so that the new defaults in
    apt-file.conf work
  * apt-file: print output from command after executing it, so that
    errors and notes from there get to the user
  * debian/apt-file.postrm: added DEBHELPER marker
  * debian/control:
    - Dropped Build-Depends-Indep: debhelper (>> 3.0.0)
    - Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 5), cdbs
    - Standards-Version: 3.7.3
    - Recommend "file", which gets used optionally for the integrity check
  * apt-file.bash_completion: filename/directory completion for "search",
    patch taken from Debian bug #448358
  * apt-file/do_grep: only search in all cache files once (LP: #174134)
  * apt-file: fix display of warning in purge_cache, if the file cannot be
    deleted
  * Applied patches from Kevin Glynn in a lot of places, see Debian bug
    #382312). Thanks!
  * Support files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ (LP: #190602) (Closes: #353275)

apt-file (2.0.8.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * The Contents.gz files map a file to the list of packages that
    contain it. do_grep grabs all these packages, this fix
    post-processes its result so that we only print out the packages
    that do match the given pattern.  Also, take account that a file
    name may have spaces and avoid false positives by tightening the
    grep pattern.  NOTE: this is a minimal NMU patch to close
    important bug #382312 (it also closes two similar bugs). 
    There is a more complete patch available in the bts for
    #382312 that I think would make apt-file much more useful and
    closes other bugs.     (Closes: #382312, #376607, #358821)
  * Updated Version String to 2.0.8.2 (Closes: #376458)
