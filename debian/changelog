apt-file (2.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Thijs Kinkhorst ]
  * Fix searching for patterns that start with a '-'. This still requires
    specifying '--' before the pattern (closes: #631438, LP: #801336)
  * Unset env variables that may influence the behaviour of grep
    (closes: #617183).
  * Japanese translation of update-notifier text by Hideki Yamane
    (closes: #641199).
  * Improve man page layout and help output text. Thanks Jari Aalto for
    the patch! (Closes: #651695)
  * rapt-file: replace dpkg-architecture call with dpkg --architecture,
    obsoleting the depends-heavy recommendation on dpkg-dev. Thanks
    helix84 (Closes: #671225).
  * Checked for policy 3.9.3, no changes needed. Add explicit python
    recommendation, even though we transitively recommended it via
    python-apt already, to satisfy Lintian.
  * Add rapt-file manual page (Closes: #613005).

  [ Enrico Zini ]
  * rapt-file: Updated distribution names, now it works on wheezy.

    python apt module in the rapt-file python code (Closes: #619414).
  * mention rapt-file in the package description (Closes: #623632)

  [ Thijs Kinkhorst ]
  * apt-file: Include compontent in Contents file search paths so we
    use ftp-master's new Contents files locations. This may break
    compatibility with older suites that do not have this configuration
    (Closes: #624734).
  * rapt-file: Ignore files not ending in .list in sources.list.d
    (Closes: #607861).

    (Closes: #613006).

  * Small packaging cleanups.

apt-file (2.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add initial version of rapt-file, which does not rely on the downloaded
    file lists, but queries dde.debian.net for every search. It does not offer
    all features of apt-file (closes: #518764).
  * Add Enrico to Uploaders.
  * Fix perl warning when $HOME is not set (closes: #527303)
  * Make diffindex-download check if stdout is a terminal instead of stdin,

apt-file (2.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

    (LP: #316155):
    - make error message less noisy

    - don't redownload the full file if it has not changed

 -- Stefan Fritsch <sf@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Feb 2009 22:46:33 +0100

apt-file (2.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ship 'diffindex-download' and 'diffindex-rred' for downloading patches
    instead of the full Contents files. Use this for http and ftp in default
    config file (closes: #373589).
  * diffindex-download uses curl with progress meter enabled by default
    (can be changed in apt-file.conf). Closes: #381613
    Therefore always depend on curl and remove dependency on wget.
  * diffindex-download prints some error messages if no connection is possible
    (closes: #357031).
  * Make 'apt-file purge' remove old content files even if the sources.list
    line has been removed in the meantime (closes: #507092).

    (closes: #506554).

apt-file (2.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use ~/.cache/apt-file as cache directory if called as non-root user,
    but fall back to the old /var/cache/apt/apt-file. This allows to use
    'apt-file update' as non-root (closes: #443728).
  * No longer search for apt-file.conf in the current directory. Instead,
    allow to choose the config file with the APT_FILE_CONFIG environment
    variable. 
  * Update bash completion (closes: #502655).
  * Add some tests and run them during build.

    generic (Closes: #489821).

apt-file (2.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

    necessary (Closes: #483406).

  [ Stefan Fritsch ]
  * Fix substring search when absolute path is given (Closes: #483624).

 -- Stefan Fritsch <sf@debian.org>  Sat, 31 May 2008 16:14:21 +0200

apt-file (2.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add new option --non-interactive/-N to skip schemes that may require user
    interaction during 'apt-file update'. This is useful for cron jobs.
  * Change BEGIN block to make 'perl -c' work.
  * Accept 'false' as an alias for 'DIRECT' in apt's proxy configuration
    (closes: #476961) and ignore case. Also print the selected proxy
    in verbose mode.
  * Run perltidy on the source code.

  [ Stefan Fritsch ]
  * Hijack package. New maintainer.
  * Add Thijs as uploader.
  * Acknowledge NMU (closes: #397381). Thanks to Gunnar Wolf and Kevin Glynn.
  * Import changes from Ubuntu. This fixes these bugs:
    - Regular expression search with -x does not really work (Closes: #259446)
    - fails to read /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ (Closes: #353275)
    - manpage says dpkg -S when it means dpkg -L (Closes: #376828)
    - please apply more complete patch to fix output (Closes: #382312)
    - silently fails when there are no file lists (Closes: #408309)
    - bash_completion: `_apt-file': not a valid identifier (Closes: #441041)
    - bash_completion does not complete filename after search command
      (Closes: #448358)
    - typo in apt-file.conf (Closes: #451840)
    Thanks to Daniel Hahler, Emmet Hikory, and Barry deFreese.
  * Fix misleading error message when cache dir does not exist
    (Closes: #456166).
  * Set umask on apt-file update to ensure cache is always world readable
    (Closes: #361878).
  * Don't show files repeatedly which are in the same package in several suites
    (Closes: #402228).
  * Allow bundling of short options (Closes: #384013).
  * Correctly extract file and directory names from apt config
    (Closes: #446621).
  * Use zfgrep to speed up non-regex searches (Closes: #470488). To be able to
    do this, we need a different way to trim the header of Contents.gz than
    used in the patch for bug #382312 (Closes: #293942).
  * Pass 'set -x' to the shell when in verbose mode.
  * Refactor apt-file.conf:
    - Move common code blocks in apt-file.conf to separate variables.
    - Use gunzip -l instead of file to check if a file is gzipped.
    - Fix misleading comments (Closes: #356790).

  * Change suggestion from ssh to openssh-client (Closes: #375578).
  * Many documentation cleanups (thanks Era Eriksson for some,
    Closes: #320322, #412133).
  * Rebuild man page from sgml during package build.
  * Change section to admin, following override.
  * Drop -N parameter from wget command since it's not allowed in
    combination with -O according to the manual (Closes: #380736).

apt-file (2.0.8.2ubuntu3) hardy; urgency=low

    - debian/control: Depend on "menu" for su-to-root
    - apt-file: test if the cache directory is empty for actions
      search/find and show/list.

    logic to match both without slash at the beginning and with slash
    inside (LP: #181600). Apply the same logic to regexp patterns (-x).
  * debian/rules:
    - moved DH_COMPAT=3 to debian/compat (increased to 5)
    - Fixed debian-rules-ignores-make-clean-error
    - Dropped binary-arch target
  * Fix typos/wording in README
  * apt-file.conf: Add integrity check for fetched files (LP: #176753)
  * apt-file: find_command: remove leading spaces and open parentheses
    before looking for the command, so that the new defaults in
    apt-file.conf work
  * apt-file: print output from command after executing it, so that
    errors and notes from there get to the user
  * debian/apt-file.postrm: added DEBHELPER marker
  * debian/control:
    - Dropped Build-Depends-Indep: debhelper (>> 3.0.0)

    - Standards-Version: 3.7.3
    - Recommend "file", which gets used optionally for the integrity check

    patch taken from Debian bug #448358
  * apt-file/do_grep: only search in all cache files once (LP: #174134)
  * apt-file: fix display of warning in purge_cache, if the file cannot be
    deleted
  * Applied patches from Kevin Glynn in a lot of places, see Debian bug

apt-file (2.0.8.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * The Contents.gz files map a file to the list of packages that
    contain it. do_grep grabs all these packages, this fix
    post-processes its result so that we only print out the packages
    that do match the given pattern.  Also, take account that a file
    name may have spaces and avoid false positives by tightening the
    grep pattern.  NOTE: this is a minimal NMU patch to close
    important bug #382312 (it also closes two similar bugs). 
    There is a more complete patch available in the bts for
    #382312 that I think would make apt-file much more useful and
    closes other bugs.     (Closes: #382312, #376607, #358821)
  * Updated Version String to 2.0.8.2 (Closes: #376458)
