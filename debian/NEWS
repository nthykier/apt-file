apt-file (3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
    - The format of /etc/apt/apt-file.conf changed.
      (the file is optional and can be removed if not needed)
    - diffindex-* have been removed.
    - show/list command defaults to -F.
    - personal "caches" no longer supported.
    - non-matching search causes non-zero exit code.
    - command line options removed and parsing changed.

  Beyond this, apt-file now uses apt's acquire system to
  download Contents files.
    - Please consult /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50apt-file.conf to
      assert you are fetching the desired Contents files
    - Run "apt update" to re-fetch the Contents files.
    - The previous system-wide cache will been removed on
      upgrade.
    - Personal caches under XDG_CACHE_HOME/apt-file or
      ~/.cache/apt-file must be removed manually.
    -  If you strongly prefer the previous behaviour of
       "apt update" and "apt-file update", then it is possible
       by reconfiguring apt and apt-file.  This is explained
       in /usr/share/doc/apt-file/README.md.gz

  Please consult the following documentation for more
  information:
    - /usr/share/doc/apt-file/README.md.gz
    - man apt-file
    - /usr/share/doc/apt-file/examples
