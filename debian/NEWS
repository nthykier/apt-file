apt-file (3.0~exp) experimental; urgency=medium

  BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES (see the changelog for
  more details)
    - diffindex-* have been removed.
    - show/list command defaults to -F.
    - personal "caches" no longer supported.
    - non-matching search causes non-zero exit code.
    - command line options removed and parsing changed.

  Beyond this, apt-file now uses apt's acquire system to
  download Contents files.
    - Please consult /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50apt-file.conf to
      assert you are fetching the desired Contents files
    - Run "apt update" to re-fetch the Contents files.
    - The previous system-wide cache will been removed on
      upgrade.
    - Personal caches under XDG_CACHE_HOME/apt-file or
      ~/.cache/apt-file must be removed manually.
