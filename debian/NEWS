apt-file (3.0~exp4) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  The new version of apt-file will by default configure apt to
  fetch Contents files on "apt update".  For users that prefer
  the previous behaviour, please consult the example config
  files provided in "/usr/share/doc/apt-file/examples" as well
  as "man apt-file" (under "CONFIGURATION FILES").

  Notably, the "apt-file-2-update.sh" script should be able to
  get you started.

  Please note that these example configurations may need some
  tweaking to work for you.

  BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES (see the changelog for
  more details)
    - diffindex-* have been removed.
    - show/list command defaults to -F.
    - personal "caches" no longer supported.

  Beyond this, apt-file now uses apt's acquire system to
  download Contents files.
    - Please consult /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50apt-file.conf to
      assert you are fetching the desired Contents files
    - Run "apt update" to re-fetch the Contents files.
    - The previous system-wide cache will been removed on
      upgrade.
    - Personal caches under XDG_CACHE_HOME/apt-file or
      ~/.cache/apt-file must be removed manually.
