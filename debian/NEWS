apt-file (3.0.0~dev) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  apt-file 3 introduces a number of changes that are not
  backwards compatible with previous versions.  If you
  are using apt-file in scripts (or cron jobs), these may
  need to be updated.

  Please refer to /usr/share/doc/apt-file/README.upgrading
  for more information.
