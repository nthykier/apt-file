.SH NAME
apt-file \- APT package searching utility -- command-line interface
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBapt-file\fR [ \fBoptions\fR ] [ \fBaction\fR ] [ \fBpattern\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBapt-file\fR is a command line tool for
searching packages for the APT packaging system.
.PP
Some actions are required to run the search:
.TP
\fBupdate\fR
Resynchronize the package contents from their sources. The
lists of the contents of packages are fetched from the location(s)
specified in
\fI/etc/apt/sources.list\fR\&. This command
attempts to fetch the
\fIContents-<ARCH>\&.gz\fR files from
remote sources.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR
Search in which package file is included. A list of all
package containing the \fBpattern\fR pattern
is returned.
.TP
\fBlist\fR
List the contents of a package matching the
\fBpattern\fR pattern. This action is very
close to the \fBdpkg -L\fR command except the
package does not need to be installed or fetched.
.TP
\fBshow\fR
Alias for \fBlist\fR\&.
.TP
\fBpurge\fR
remove all \fIContents-<ARCH>\&.gz\fR
files in cache directory.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB   --cache | -c cache-directory \fR
Sets the cache directory to
cache-directory instead of its default
value (\fI/var/cache/apt\fR) thus you can
use \fBapt-file\fR even if you do not have
administrator privileges.
.TP
\fB   --verbose | -v \fR
Run \fBapt-file\fR in verbose mode.
.TP
\fB   --cdrom-mount | -d cdrom-mount-point \fR
Use cdrom-mount-point instead of
\fBapt\fR\&'s.
.TP
\fB   --ignore-case | -i \fR
Do not expand pattern\&.
.TP
\fB   --regexp | -x \fR
Treat pattern as a regular expression.
.TP
\fB   --version | -V \fR
Show version number.
.TP
\fB   --architecture | -a architecture \fR
Sets architecture to architecture\&. This
option is useful if you search a package for a different
architecture from the one installed on your system.
.TP
\fB   --sources-list | -s sources.list \fR
Sets the \fIsources.list\fR file to a
different value from its default
\fI/etc/apt/sources.list\fR\&.
.TP
\fB   --package-only | -l \fR
Only display package name. Do not display file names.
.TP
\fB   --fixed-string | -F \fR
Do not expand search pattern with generic characters at
pattern's end.
.TP
\fB   --dummy | -y \fR
Run in dummy mode (no action).
.TP
\fB   --help | -h \fR
Display a short help screen.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
.PP
The \fBapt-file\fR configuration file
(\fI/etc/apt/apt-file.conf)\fR changed from
version 1 to version 2. Now only fetch backends are defined in
the configuration file. Thus it is much easier to configure
proxies.
.PP
A string expension is done on several values. See string
expension section.
.TP
\fBdestination\fR
This variable describes how cached files will be named.
.TP
\fBhttp | ftp | ssh | rsh | file | cdrom\fR
Define are the commands used to fetch files.
.SS "STRING EXPANSION"
.PP
A \fIsources.list\fR entry is defined as:

.nf
	  deb uri dist component1 component2 ...
	
.fi
A uri is defined as:

.nf
	  proto:/[/][user[:password]@]host[:port][/path]
	
.fi
.TP
\fB<host>\fR
replace with the hostname.
.TP
\fB<port>\fR
replace with the port number.
.TP
\fB<uri>\fR
replace with full uri
.TP
\fB<path>\fR
replace with full path (relative to / on the host)
.TP
\fB<dist>\fR
replace with distribution name
.TP
\fB<comp>\fR
replace with component name
.TP
\fB<cache>\fR
replace with cache directory
.TP
\fB<dest>\fR
replace with destination expanded
value.
.TP
\fB<cdrom>\fR
replace with cdrom-mount-point\&.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fB\fI/etc/apt/sources.list\fB\fR
Locations to fetch package contents from.
.TP
\fB\fI/etc/apt/apt-file.conf\fB\fR
